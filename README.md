## The challenge:
- Finding safe parking spots. Currently, three million drivers compete for just 300,000 spots designated for truck parking, according to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
- Right now, no system exists to advise drivers of available spaces to stop for a break or to take their mandated rest.

## The features and benefits of the project:
- Truckers, freight operators and logistics companies could...
  - Improve safety
  - Reduce delivery costs and increase freight movement connectivity
  - Improve reliability and access to local, regional and international markets
- Police could...
  - Help direct drivers to available parking areas

## How users can get started with the project:
We encourage you to review the [data](https://www.smartcolumbusos.com/data) and discover how apps or other solutions could help truckers find open spots.

## Ultimate vision:
An application enabling truckers to reserve a spot, even before they leave distribution centers, that will also show parking site amenities from showers, to food options, to religious services.
